### It's time to learn [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/). There is a list of branches below which contains code source that I have been learning:

 - [Prisma quickstart](https://github.com/Shodlik-Shomuratov/Prisma/tree/prisma-quickstart) - Prisma from scratch using a plain TypeScript. It covers data modeling, migrations and querying a database.
